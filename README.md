# ZigBee-IoT-Demo
It's a simple demo project for using xbee with arduino to make a IoT device

# Steps

1. Using X-CTU software to configure coordinator and router with same PAN ID

2. Set coordinator as API mode, router as AT mode

3. Set D3 in I/O setting as ADC for analog input

4. Set I/O sampling Rate as 1388 in hex (5000ms) in I/O sampling setting

5. Following my Wiring layout and put things together

6. Writing Arduino code and upload to coordinator
