# ZigBee-IoT-Demo
It's a simple demo project for using xbee with arduino to make a IoT device

# Steps

1. Using X-CTU software set up XBee
 * configure coordinator and router with same PAN ID
 * Set coordinator as API mode, router as AT mode
 * Set D3 in I/O setting as ADC for analog input
 * Set I/O sampling Rate as 1388 in hex (5000ms) in I/O sampling setting
2. Following my Wiring layout and put things together
3. Writing Arduino code and upload to coordinator and router
